Start Apache CouchDB and create a database named `couchdbschool` by
using HTTP.

After you created the database, please insert this document:

```js
{
  "_id": "robert",
  "type": "human"
}
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can use curl or a http client in whatever programming language you
want to use.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify
```

to proceed. The result will be tested, a report will be generated,
and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
